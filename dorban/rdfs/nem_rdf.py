    r"""
    Function to compute the fluxes on two opposite boundaries of a cartesian two dimensional cell,
    assuming the currents on the boundaries of the cell are known. The k multiplication factor is also known.
    The computation is done using the NEM approximation. The flux is integrated in the axi transverse to the direction
    of the boundaries. Then the flux expanded in the NEM basis :math:`\phi(x)=\phi_0+\Sigma_i a_i\cdot f_i(x)`.
    Where :math:`\phi_0` is the average flux in the cell and

    .. math:: f_1(x) = x; f_2(x) = 3x^2-\frac{1}{4}; f_3(x) = x^3 - \frac{1}{4}x; f_4(x) = x^4 - \frac{3}{10}x^2 + \frac{1}{80}.

    Then four equation are written to determine the values of :math:`a_i`. The first three are the first three moment of
    the diffusion equation, the last one is an equation about the current at the right boundary.
    Then the flux on the boundaries is deduced from :math:`a_i` and :math:`\phi_0`.

    """
    Function to compute reference discontinuity factors (rdfs) of a two-dimensional cartesian system using the NEM approximation.
    Assuming the currents between any two cells in known and the k eigenvalue is also known.
    This function is useful to compute rdfs from a unit cell computation, if all the currents between the
    cell are also known from the unit cell computations.
    If the average flux in each cell is given it is used, if it isn't given it is deduced from the currents.
    The computation of the average flux from the currents might be less exact than using the average flux computed
    in a unit cell computation, for example if a Monte Carlo code is used for the unit cell computation, so it is
    better to provide it.

    Parameters
    ----------
    system: Core
     The core whose rdfs are computed. Assumed to be two-dimensional.
    currents: np.array
     Array of the current between each two cells, the shape of this array is the number of cells times the number
     of faces of each cell times the number of energy groups.
    k: float
     The k multiplication factor of the system.
    fluxes: Optional[np.array]
     The average flux at each cell. If it is known the average fluxes are deduced from the currents.

    Returns
    -------
    np.array
     Array of the reference discontinuity factors of each cell on each face.
