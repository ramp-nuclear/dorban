    The shape of the axial leakage is assumed to be quadratic, it is determined
    by the leakage in the cell and the leakage at the adjoin cells, there are
    2 coefficients that have to be computed in order to determine the leakage shape
    in each cell.
    This function computes and returns them.
    This function gets the required data about a cell and its two neighbors,
    and it computes the leakage in an axis which is transverse to the line
    that connects the cell and its two neighbors. The function implements the analytical solution of the three linear
    equations obtained from the conditions on the leakage at the cell and its neighbors.

    Parameters
    ----------
    cell_leakage: np.array
     the leakage in the main cell in the transverse axis direction
    left_leakage: np.array
     the leakage in the left cell in the transverse axis direction
    right_leakage: np.array
      the leakage in the right cell in the transverse axis direction
    length_c: float
     the length of the cell in the main axis
    length_l: float
     the length of the left cell in the main axis
    length_r: float
     the length of the right cell in the main axis

    Returns
    -------
    Tuple[np.array, np.array]
     the coefficients of the leakage function at the cell in all
    energy groups , the first value is the linear coefficient and the second is
    the quadratic one.
